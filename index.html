                                    Rahane was selected in the Test squad to play against West Indies in November 2011. Rahane was taken in the squad for 16 months and in his 
                                    presence, he saw seven players make their debuts.[29] His performance in the limited-overs cricket (ODI and T20I) during that period was not 
                                    up to the mark, as he averaged around 25 in both ODI and T20I cricket, and struggled for form in the series against Pakistan and England (in January 2013).
                                    Rahane made his Test debut on 22 March 2013 against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, Delhi.Rahane was handed his India 
                                    Test cap which brought an end to a lean patch for Mumbai, who had not produced a Test player for India since May 2007. Two single-digit scores in the 
                                    game prompted many to question Rahane's ability to handle pressure and replicate his domestic success at international level.

                                    The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting tal
                                    ent and also tried other wicket-keeper/batsmen like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik. With Dhoni performing well for the India A squad, he was 
                                    picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in December 2004. Dhoni made his debut in the first match of the series and was run out for a 
                                    duck. Dhoni was picked for the subsequent ODI series against Pakistan. In the second match of the series in Visakhapatnam, Dhoni playing in his 
                                    fifth one-day international, scored 148 runs off 123 deliveries which surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-ke
                                    eper. Dhoni played in the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series in Octoberâ€“November 2005 and was promoted to No. 3 in the batting order in the third

                                    he highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper and was described in Wisden Almanack as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'. It was also the highe
                                    st individual score in ODI cricket in a run chase, a record which was broken seven years later by Shane Watson. Dhoni ended the series with the 
                                    highest aggregate of 346 runs and was awarded the Man of the series.

                                    team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the field. He commenced the

                                    In the inaugural 2008 Indian Premier League season, Royal Challengers Bangalore, then owned by Vijay Mallya, acquired Kohli for $50,000 f
                                    ollowing his performances in the Under-19 World Cup. Kohli managed one run in the opening match against Kolkata Knight Riders and initially 
                                    struggled in the middle order. A brief promotion to the top order in a match against the Deccan Chargers offered a glimpse of form, but he 
                                    soon returned to his original position. He concluded the season with 165 runs, as Bangalore finished seventh in the league standings. In th
                                    e 2009 season, Kohli began with a series of low scores but found form with a half-century in the third match. Despite limited opportunities, 
                                    he made crucial contributions, notably in the semi-final victory over Chennai Super Kings. However, he was dismissed for 7 in the final, as 
                                    Bangalore lost to Deccan Chargers by eight runs, finishing as runners-up.
                                    The 2010 season saw Kohli elevated to the role of vice-captain. He emerged as a reliable middle-order batter and an athletic fielder, with a 
                                    notable 58 against the Deccan Chargers. Bangalore reached the playoffs but were eliminated by Mumbai Indians in the semi-final, where Kohli 
                                    was again dismissed for 7. In the 2010 Champions League T20, he delivered key performances, scoring 47 and 49* to help Bangalore reach the se
                                    mi-finals before falling to Chennai. Ahead of the 2011 season, Kohli was the sole player retained by Bangalore for $1.8 million. After a stea
                                    dy start, he hit peak form with a string of impactful innings, including a half-century and consecutive Player of the Match awards. He also st
                                    epped in as captain during Daniel Vettoriâ€™s absence and earned praise for his leadership. Bangalore topped the league table and advanced to th
                                    e final, where Kohli contributed 35 runs in a losing cause.

                                <p class="about-paragraph">
                                    Kohli's international career began in August 2008 when the 19-year-old had a "surprise call-up" to the ODI squad for a tour of Sri Lanka. He ope
                                    ned the batting due to injuries to senior players, scoring his first half-century in the fourth match. After a brief stint with the India A team, 
                                    he scored a century against a strong Australian bowling line-up in a tour match. Despite an early BCCI contract, Kohli's place in the team was 
                                    not secure. A turning point came in the 2009 Emerging Players Tournament in Australia, where he was the top run-scorer, leading his team to victo
                                    ry with a century in the final. This performance cemented his return to the national side. He scored his maiden ODI century in December 2009 agai
                                    nst Sri Lanka. By early 2010, he became the third Indian to score two ODI centuries before turning 22.
                                    In 2010, Kohli was appointed vice-captain for a tri-series in Zimbabwe and became the then fastest Indian to score 1,000 ODI runs. After a dip in 
                                    form during the 2010 Asia Cup, he solidified his position with consistent performances, finishing as India's leading ODI run-scorer for the year.
                                    Kohli played a crucial role in India's 2011 World Cup victory, scoring a century on his debut and a 35 in the final. Further made his Test debut 
                                    in June 2011 against the West Indies, but struggled initially and was dropped. He was recalled and eventually found his footing, scoring his maid
                                    en Test century in Adelaide in January 2012.[46] He continued to score runs in ODIs, with an unbeaten 133 against Sri Lanka and a career-best 183 
                                    against Pakistan in the 2012 Asia Cup, being the standout performances
